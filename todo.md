# TODO

## Deploy & identity system — DONE (2026-07-16)

The whole code-delivery + station-identity backbone is built, pushed, and verified in-world.
Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-station-identity-and-deploy-design.md`.

- **`update <pkg>`** (`src/update.lua`) — self-updates (relaunches new copy in one run), pulls a
  package's files from `src/packages.lua` (cache-busted `http.get`, overwrites), registers with
  the hub → unique label (`slot2` / `slot2+pong1`), and writes an auto-run `startup` supervisor.
- **Hub v0 registrar** (`src/hub.lua`) — rednet `ccvegas` service; persistent `computerID→{pkg:n}`
  table; idempotent, collision-free naming. Hosts hostname `hub`. **Always-on** (force-load it).
- **Installer floppies** (`src/mkinstaller.lua`) — master tools disk (`/disk/update slot`) or a
  per-package auto-install-on-reboot disk. Web fetch of `update.lua` happens once, ever.
- **Auto-run supervisor** — station boots into its game + self-heals (crash / Ctrl+T /
  chunk-reload). Break-out: hold a key at boot, Ctrl+T, or a key in the 3s post-exit window.
- **Fail-loud preflight** — missing drive/modem = hard stop; hub offline = loud REGISTRATION
  FAILED (files still install).

## Idle / lag model + station framework — DONE (2026-07-16)

Built, deployed, verified in-world. Then generalized so every station inherits idle-safety.

- **Hub-driven presence** — the hub has an Advanced Peripherals **Player Detector** and runs the
  *only* forever-loop; it edge-broadcasts `presence` over rednet. Stations deep-sleep on
  `os.pullEvent` (zero cost) and wake on presence or a local lever edge. **Pull-able presence**
  (`presence?` query) syncs boot-while-occupied + lever-wake-outside-range.
  Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-idle-lag-model-design.md`.
- **Shared `lib/idle_runner.lua`** — owns deep-sleep/wake/presence and draws `<name>_advert`. A
  station is now just a play file + a `<basename>_advert.lua`. `src/` reorganized into
  `hub/ slot/ pong/ lib/` (deploy flattens by name, so `require()` is unchanged). **slot** and
  **pong** both run on it — pong gained idle-safety it never had.
  Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-station-folders-and-idle-runner-design.md`.
- Advanced Peripherals capabilities catalogued in `kb/advanced-peripherals.md`.
- Idle state = a static `COME PLAY / GET MONEY` advert (drawn once, zero cost); present = the game.
- (Not measured: exact tick-cost numbers — qualitatively confirmed idle stations cost ~nothing.)

## Known gaps / parked

- **No station reset/deregister.** `.installed` accumulates (merge-only) and the hub registry
  reserves `computerID → instance` forever (idempotent by immutable ID). No uninstall/reset command;
  `update <pkg>` just relabels from that run's packages. Harmless while self-contained (no
  collisions); revisit if recycling machines. Would need a hub `deregister` msg + a local `reset`.

## Hub economy — core loop DONE + in-world verified (2026-07-16). Currency = **M-Bucks (MB)**

Vertical-slice step 1 complete. Full reference: **`kb/economy.md`** (read it before extending the economy).
Currency is **M-Bucks** (full *Mia-Bucks*, abbrev **MB**) — the unit of every balance/stake/payout.
Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-hub-economy-design.md`;
plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-16-hub-economy.md`. Bet-and-risk slot on a hub-authoritative
ledger, layered so a 2nd game reuses it: **core** (`lib/ledger` pure · `lib/card` · `lib/wallet`
+outbox) → **SP gateway** (`lib/sp_econ`) → tiny per-game payout (`slot/slot_pay`). All 8 code tasks
passed per-task review + a whole-branch review (deploy/package completeness + protocol end-to-end PASS).

- [x] **Member card read/write** — `lib/card` reads/writes floppy `{ id, score-mirror }`; no card = anonymous free-play.
- [x] **rednet economy protocol** — `bet{id,stake}→bet_ok|bet_deny`, `credit{id,delta}→balance`,
      `query{id}→balance`, `mint{name,balance}→minted`. Hub persists the ledger (`ledger.tbl`), sole writer.
- [x] **Slot payout model** — fixed stake, per-symbol paytable, triple-seven jackpot (`slot_pay`).
- [x] **Show balance** — economy header (player · balance · stake · win / INSUFFICIENT / FREE PLAY).
- [x] **Admin card issue** — `issue <name> [balance]` mints ledger id + writes the floppy (hub needs a drive).
- [x] **In-world verification** — deployed; mint→insert→bet→win/lose→insufficient→eject(anon)→
      hub-offline-outbox all confirmed working. Hub + slot stations have disk drives.

## → NEXT: Lua UI deepdive + slot-machine finishing touches

The active next build (user-set 2026-07-16). Two intertwined threads:
- **Lua UI deepdive + workflow** — a patterns/toolkit pass on monitor UIs (the `lib/subpixel` canvas,
  layout, text, headers, advert screens) + a smoother build/iterate loop. Start from the cc-lua
  **`kb/monitor-ui.md`**. New behavior → brainstorm first.
  - **DONE — resolution lesson** (`docs/monitor-resolution-lesson.html`): interactive datasheet of the
    cell (6×9) / subpixel (2×3, 2-colour) / real-px model, taught through `slot.lua`. Verified: glyph
    6×9 (CraftOS-PC gfxmode + CC font), teletext behaviour (`src/lib/subpixel.lua`).
  - **DONE — mockup tool** (`tools/monitor-mockup.html`): browser subpixel pixel-art editor. Paint a
    whole-monitor screen freeform; a live `encodeCell` preview shows the 2-colour-per-cell truth;
    RGB-editable palette; tagged cell-grid text regions; JSON+PNG export (JSON = Claude's source of
    truth → regenerate Lua). Spec + plan in `docs/superpowers/`. **Iterate loop:** user draws → exports
    JSON → Claude reads it → generates `subpixel.lua` draw code. NOT in the `src/` deploy loop.
  - **DONE — resolution formula exact.** Block→cell pulled from CC `ServerMonitor.rebuild`; slot
    1×2 @0.5 = **15×24** (not 15×21). See `kb/monitor-resolution.md`. MB `$`→`MB` swap shipped (a05efce).
  - **DONE — slot v3 built** (spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-slot-v3-design.md`, plan
    `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-16-slot-v3.md`). Rebuilt `slot.lua` to fixed 15×24 bands: card
    header, `WIN:`+amount, red top/bottom frame bars, **solid-black reel window showing 3 symbols per
    reel**, side + bar bulbs, stake row with purple/gray bg art. Reuses GRAD gradient + `bulb()`; all
    text white; header/WIN text bg bound to the animated gradient slot. **3 selectable stakes**
    ($10/$25/$100) via **monitor_touch** — tap the on-screen stake labels; persists across spins,
    resets to $10 on wake. Economy stake-variable: `slot_pay.eval(result,stake)`+`STAKES`,
    `sp_econ.tryBet(stake)` captures `stakedStake`, `settle` pays against it. Tests 15/15; reviewed.
    - **Iteration after first in-world screenshot** (owner feedback): reel window was 1-symbol + showed
      the gradient (should be **black, 3 symbols**); stakes were an **unwired redstone cycle button**
      (switched to **touch** — owner drew them as buttons). Fixed both; layout translated more faithfully.
      Verified offline by rendering the subpixel layer to PNG (sim reuses real `subpixel.lua`+symbols).
    - **Operational v3 build DONE** (from `tools/slot-preview.html`, the approved on-screen design;
      built from `docs/mockups/slot-v3.json` → mockup(2)). New `src/lib/pixelfont.lua` (pure, unit-tested):
      the **WIN:** label bitmap + **slashed big-number font** (owner-drawn "0", 1-9 extrapolated).
      `slot.lua` rewritten: header (native CC text) row 2, WIN: + **count-up** amount (0→payout over
      ~1s), top red bar, **3×3 reel** rows 11-19 (only middle row black, top/bottom on gradient),
      bottom red bar, **stake buttons** rows 23-24 (native "$10/$25/$100" cell-text in the top cell,
      full-magenta selected / gray). **Celebration:** bars-only yellow flash on win. **Outcome overlay:**
      green(WIN)/red(Loss) over the stakes. **Stakes = monitor_touch** (tap the button; persists,
      resets to $10 on wake). `pixelfont` added to `packages.lua`. Tests 24/24; whole-file review clean.
    - **IN-WORLD VERIFIED (2026-07-16)** — owner confirmed "it works!". Post-verify fixes shipped:
      (a) stray corner bulb — side bulb lanes now start below the top red bar; (b) **reel rubber-band** —
      the reel snapped `pos=0` from an arbitrary position, so after `SYMBOL_PX` changed it jumped a
      symbol back; now `slot_logic.stepReel` **eases forward into the nearest aligned stop** (pos a
      multiple of `NUM_SYMBOLS*symbolPx` → final centred), no snap (tests updated). Free-play shows a
      static "0" by design (no card = no payout); insert a card to see the count-up.
    - **Workflow codified (owner's request):** the mockup → live `tools/slot-preview.html` preview →
      Lua → **offline PNG verify** → deploy loop is now the **golden standard** in
      `kb/monitor-ui-workflow.md` (+ SKILL pointer). SKILL's hard-rule reconciled: **`monitor_touch`
      IS diegetic** (physical in-world interaction), ban is keyboard/terminal-GUI only.
    - **Post-verify polish shipped:** reel-stop eased (no rubber-band); **currency reverted to `$`**
      (M-Bucks/MB retired — header shows `id: $bal`); leftmost red-bar bulb removed (it straddled the
      canvas-edge cells → `encodeCell` squashed it — see `kb/monitor-ui.md`); selected stake = **yellow**.
    - Parked slot polish: celebration art beyond the bar flash; text colours; **advert screen** (see NEXT).

## Cage (diegetic sink) — v1 shipped (2026-07-16), in-world verification PENDING

The `$` exit. A kiosk where a member card's `$` becomes real metal (droppers spitting ingots on the
floor) and metal becomes `$`. Bidirectional, flat rate, hub-authoritative.
Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-16-diegetic-sink-cage-design.md`;
plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-16-diegetic-sink-cage.md` (all 10 tasks done, per-task +
whole-branch review clean). Owner-approved layout: `tools/cage-preview.html` (clickable; it IS
the source of truth for the built UI).

**What shipped:** `src/cage/` station (`cage.lua` play loop + UI, `cage_rates`/`cage_vault` pure
logic, `cage_hw` peripheral I/O, `cage_symbols` ingot sprites, `cage_advert` idle face) on the
existing `idle_runner` framework, plus `lib/cage_econ.lua` (card-session gateway, sibling of
`sp_econ`). Deploy: `cage` package added to `src/packages.lua` (manifest verified against the tree).
All 10 plan tasks landed; per-task + whole-branch review clean.

**Tuning knobs:** `cage_rates.DENOMS` (denomination table — item, `$` value, label; **≤6 entries**,
see the CEILING note in the file — a 7th collides with the idle advert's rate-table rows vs. the
bottom bar); `cage_rates.QTYS = {1, 5, 20}` (the withdraw multiplier ladder, resets to 1x on wake);
dropper count (**any count ≥2**, all on one shared redstone line, never the modem's side — more
droppers = faster shower drain; the first real build uses 4); shower cadence (tick-driven via
`cage_vault.pulseLoads` on a **6-tick phase cycle** — 2 high, 4 low = 0.3s/item/dropper, pacing the
dropper's 4-tick rising-edge cooldown. On/off MUST straddle a yield and it must never become a
blocking `sleep()` loop — see `[[redstone-pulse-needs-a-yield]]`, `[[event-pump-reentrancy]]`).

**Hardware is DISCOVERED, not configured (2026-07-17).** Network names are **not stable across
identically-built cages** — CC hands out `<type>_<n>` from the lowest free index on that network and
any attach/detach burns a number (the first real build's droppers came up **1-4, not 0-3**). So a
cage finds its own kit by TYPE at boot: droppers = every `minecraft:dropper`; **deposit = the
lowest-named non-dropper inventory** (attach the player-facing one first), vault = the next; monitor
= the one that is **36×24 @0.5** (by SIZE, not `peripheral.find("monitor")` — a cage with two
monitors attached was a coin flip). A standard build needs **no `cage.cfg` at all**.

> **`cage.cfg` exists because `update cage` OVERWRITES `cage.lua`.** It is not in the package file
> list, so it survives a push — it is the ONLY place per-station wiring belongs. Never put wiring in
> `cage.lua`'s config block; the next `update` deletes it. cfg always wins over discovery. `side` is
> the one thing that can't be discovered.

**`cage test`** — the setup tool. `cage test` lists attached peripherals, every monitor's size, the
resolved config **and where each value came from** (`(auto)` / `(cage.cfg)` / `(NOT FOUND)`), and the
vault's contents; it runs *before* the boot hard-stops so it can diagnose a cage that won't start.
`cage test drop <metal> [qty]` showers real metal **debiting nobody** — the one check only the server
can answer. Fails loud (not a crash) on a grey modem, >2 non-dropper inventories (a hopper would
otherwise sort ahead of the barrels and become the deposit box), or a wrong-sized `monitor=`.

**Verified in-world setup (first real cage):** Sophisticated Storage barrels work — they expose
`inventory`, so `list()`/`pushItems()` need no special handling. `barrel_0` = deposit, `barrel_1` =
vault, `dropper_1..4`, modem on the **right** (kept reachable), redstone out on **back**, drive on
the left, monitor `monitor_0`.

**In-world verification: PENDING.** Post-merge+push checklist (per the plan's post-plan section):
walk-up wake → card insert → mixed deposit incl. junk → withdraw each denom at 1x/5x/20x →
spam-tap overlap → vault-empty deny → insufficient deny → hub-offline both directions (fail-closed
withdraw, outboxed deposit) → eject mid-shower.

- **Rates (flat, symmetric):** copper $25 · iron $100 · gold $250 · diamond $1000. `cage/cage_rates.lua`.
- **Hardware:** computer + advanced monitor **2×2 @0.5 = 36×24 cells** + disk drive + wired modem +
  deposit chest + vault chest + 2–3 droppers (each a modem, all sharing ONE redstone line).
- **Vault fed by deposits** — the metal players cash in IS the metal others cash out. Empty ⇒ deny.
- **Kiosk, no confirm:** qty (1x/5x/20x) + tap a metal = immediate debit + shower. Spam = overflow.
- **Core additions that pay forward to `mp_econ`:** `wallet.debit` (the honest debit primitive — an MP
  pot is "debit each player, credit the winner"; the trading station is the same pair), `credit_deny`
  (**closes latent F2**), `pixelfont` scale + the owner's two `$` glyphs.
- **Known MP blocker, named not built:** `card.read()` takes the **first** drive with a disk.
  Single-card-per-station is baked in; `mp_econ` needs `card.readAll()`/`card.read(drive)`.
- **Card-session extraction is a rule-of-three call** — `sp_econ` + `cage_econ` are instances 1 and 2;
  extract `lib/card_session.lua` when `mp_econ` makes three.

### UI patterns settled here (reusable — see also `kb/monitor-ui-workflow.md`)

- **The palette, not screen space, is the scarce resource.** 16 slots, global to the monitor: cage
  spends 4 on the gradient, 10 on content, 2 free. A station affords **one** bevel ramp shared by all
  its buttons — which makes a bevel a station's signature, not decoration.
- **Bevel button** (`drawBevel`, light top/left + dark bottom/right, swapped when pushed). **Steel is
  the only true ramp in CC's stock 16** (white 240 / lightGray 153 / gray 76 = +87/−77): the greens
  are 161/132/17 (no highlight) and red 114 / brown 106 are 8 apart (no shadow). Costs no slots.
  Corner cells see 3 colours and squash — a 2-cell price, accepted.
- **Delta-tinted counter** — a rolling number tints by direction: **gold up, pink down**, white at
  rest. The tint is the feedback. **Pink, not red:** stock red is luminance 114 against the gold
  band's ~118, so a red number vanishes on half the drift, and a cell holds 2 colours so no outline
  can save it.
- **`monitor_touch` has no release event** — every "pressed" look is a timed flash (`FLASH_TICKS = 8`).
- **Two `$` glyphs = two SIZES, not two scales** (`pixelfont.SIGN_SM` 5×10 / `SIGN_LG` 7×14). `scale`
  doubles pixels; hand-drawn detail beats doubling. Scale stays orthogonal.
- **Open question for in-world verification:** do server-thread peripheral calls (`chest.list`,
  `pushItems`) pump the event queue and eat a pending tick timer? tweaked.cc is silent on timing.
  `cage.lua` re-arms the timer after every touch handler to guarantee liveness regardless.

## → NEXT queue (owner-set 2026-07-16, roughly in priority order)

0. ~~**Build the cage**~~ — **DONE, see the Cage section above.** In-world verification still pending.
1. **General multiplayer capabilities** — the core is already SP/MP-agnostic (`lib/ledger·card·wallet`).
   Build `lib/mp_econ` (multi-card pot / interactive wagers) + a first 2–4-player game or MP mode. Own spec.
2. **Economy bug — floppy-swap freeze (open).** Station *sometimes* freezes (no crash; reboot to clear)
   when swapping floppy disks; the `1a7d9d7` fix helped but didn't eliminate it. Repro + root-cause per
   `kb/economy.md` "Open follow-up" (likely a nested `os.pullEvent`/rednet path still reachable from
   `sp_econ.onEvent`/`disk_eject`). See `[[event-pump-reentrancy]]`.
3. **Slot advert-screen UI session** — the idle `slot_advert.lua` (COME PLAY / GET MONEY) is a plain
   default-palette screen. Give it the full treatment via the golden-standard loop (`kb/monitor-ui-workflow.md`):
   owner mockup → `tools/slot-preview.html`-style preview → subpixel art / `pixelfont` → deploy. It's the
   station's face while idle, so it matters. Reuse `pixelfont` + the gradient/bulb kit.
4. **More minigames** — 1–4 player, monitor / Create-contraption / hybrid. Each its own brainstorm→spec→build.

Parked (each its own spec later):
- **Trading station** — transfer **`$` between member cards** (players may hold multiple cards);
  hub-mediated (debit sender id, credit receiver id — two id-scoped ledger writes). Diegetic amount +
  confirm controls. Reuses the core; `wallet.debit` (built for the cage) is already its primitive.
  See `kb/economy.md`.
- **Scoreboards** — display-only rednet subscribers rendering standings around the floor.
- **Multiplayer economy** (`lib/mp_econ`) — multi-card pot / interactive wagers; core already SP/MP-agnostic.

Non-blocking follow-ups from the final review (see the SDD ledger F1/F2):
- ~~**F1** `wallet.request` blocking event pump~~ **FIXED (1a7d9d7)** — it swallowed slot.lua's tick
  timer on a mid-session card hot-swap → frozen monitor. Now stashes + re-queues foreign events and
  caches the hub id (keeps `rednet.lookup` out of the hot path). The under-rated review finding, made real in-world.
- ~~**F2** credit to an *unknown* id would be treated as acked (win silently lost)~~ **FIXED** (the
  cage task) — hub now replies `credit_deny{id, reason="unknown"}`; `wallet.credit`/`flush` treat it
  as a terminal deny, never re-outboxed. See `kb/economy.md`.

## slot.lua tuning knobs (if revisited)

- Reel feel: `SPIN_SPEED0` / `DECAY` / `MIN_SPEED` (`slot_logic.lua`), stop ticks 12/20/28 (`slot.lua`).
- Gradient: `GRAD_DEEP` / `GRAD_TEAL` and drift rate `tick * 0.05` (`slot.lua`).
- Layout: viewport at `cv.h * 0.34`, `barH`, bulb spacing (`topLayout` in `slot.lua`).
- Config: `TOP_NAME`, `SPIN_SIDE`, `SPIN_LEVEL=13`, `STAKE_SIDE`, `STAKE_LEVEL=13` (`slot.lua`).
- Layout (v3): fixed 15×24 cell-row bands in `topLayout` (`R(row)` helper); reel viewport = rows 15–17.
- Stakes: `STAKES={10,25,100}` (`slot/slot_pay.lua`); cycle button on `STAKE_SIDE`, `stakeIdx` a `play()`-local.
- Payout: per-symbol multiplier `cherry 3× · bell 5× · bar 8× · seven 25× (jackpot)`; payout = `stake × mult`
  (`slot/slot_pay.lua`, `eval(result,stake)`). Starting card balance default `100` (`issue`).

## slot v1 — status (complete)

Lever-triggered spin on a 1×2 advanced monitor; 3 reels with downward scroll + deceleration;
palette-driven blue↔teal gradient; framed reel viewport (symbols clipped behind bars); 4-sided
animated bulbs; WIN/LOSE detection + banner + gold win flash. Files: `src/slot.lua`,
`src/slot_logic.lua`, `src/slot_symbols.lua`, `src/lib/subpixel.lua`.
